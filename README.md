# Twitter_Sentiment_Analysis

Twitter is a big storehouse of human emotions and how people react to situations every second. this emotional data can be used for sentiment analysis.
We use the process of tokenization ie; by dividing th received tweet into different parts.
By the model called as Bag of Words model we count the no. of times a word has been repeated in a tweet and the appraoch to this program is Lexicon Based. 
We use app.twitter.com and make an account in twitter api then we get 4 tokens 2 Consumer API keys and 2 Access token & access token secret as the two main keys for the same. 
We use the witter api system connect it to the sentiment analyzer and use it in the script. 
The to main libraries in this program are tweepy and textblob.
In the end we get to factors to measure polarity means emotions expressed in a sentence eg:emotional negative (-2), rational negative (-1), neutral (0), rational positive (+1), and emotional positive (+2) and subjectivity means personal feeling, views or beliefs.
